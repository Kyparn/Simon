  <h1>Web standards</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <b>"You affect the world by what you browse."</b></br>
    Tim Berners-Lee</br>
    The inventor of the world wide web.

 <article>So when you are about to start to build your web page there are some <b>standards</b> that shoud be on your list.
So what do i mean whit this?</br> In recent years the term has been more associated whit the best practices for building web sites. So how do for fill the standards?</br>
To meet the set goals for web standards, your pages must follow the W3C's recommendations, most common W3C standards are <i>HTML</i> and <i>XHTML</i>, use <i>CSS</i> to separate content and layout and make sure that it
will work in all browsers.</br>
Whitout developer working together we would need different browser to wiew all the sites, and the serach engines would not be so powerful.</br>
Before the standard and World Wide Web the internet existed almost exclusively to provide information on pages whit text. Ofcourse to exchanging information is a good thing,
but it was no fun or interesting to common person. It was boring. There was no pictures and the text was not always that easy to understand.

<h2>How standards came about</h2>
<article>
  In the year of 1989 Tim Berners put together a document "Information Management: A Proposal" that laid out his vision for the World Wide Web.</br>
  In october 1990 Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation for the Web:</br>
  <ul>
  <li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</li> 
  <li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier (also known as URL)</li>
  <li>HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol</li>
</ul>
